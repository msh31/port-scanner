# Port Scanner

A high-performance network port scanner built in C++ for learning networking concepts and system programming.

## üéØ Project Overview

Educational project exploring network programming fundamentals through progressive port scanning toolkit development. Demonstrates practical socket programming, multi-threading, and network security concepts.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Winsock API and network programming
- Multi-threaded concurrent processing  
- Socket management and error handling
- Performance optimization techniques

## üìö Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Single-port TCP connection testing
- Basic socket creation and RAII management
- Timeout and error handling

### Phase 2: Multi-Port Scanning  
- Sequential and concurrent port range scanning
- Thread pool optimization
- Progress reporting

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Service detection and banner grabbing
- Multiple scan types (SYN, UDP, stealth)
- Network range scanning (CIDR support)

### Phase 4: Professional Tools
- GUI interface development
- Configuration and reporting systems
